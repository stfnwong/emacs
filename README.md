# EMACS CONFIG 
Place to store my emacs config

## LSP Configs 
Its not clear to me why the LSP configs are complete. There should be a number of keybindings that are included out of the box that seem to do nothing, for instance, jump to reference.

Also while using chords that start with super are fine on mac, it turns out that how well this works on Linux depends a lot on what kind of DE you run. I am trying to change all the "s-l" command leaders over to something like "M-L".
